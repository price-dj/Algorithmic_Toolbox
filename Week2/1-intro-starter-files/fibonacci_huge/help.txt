Hi Md. Ikramul Murad,

about the #5 FibonacciHuge algorithm:

I used 2 facts about the Fibonacci modulus (I've found online):

1) The Fibonacci sequence mod m is periodic, with period less than m^2;

2) Each Pisano period starts with 01 and then does not have 01 repeated (you can rely on the fact that when you see next 01, it means the next period has started.)

3) The fact from the instructions: Fn mod m = Fr mod m, where r = n % pisanoPeriodLength; (Ex.: F2015 mod 3 = F7 mod 3 = 1)

So the algorithm:

Step 1: Find pisanoPeriodLength by iterating from 0 to m^2-1 and calculating Fi % m without calculating the Fi itself ( F(i+2) mod m = F(i) mod m + F(i+1) mod m );

As soon as you get F(i) mod m = 0 and F(i+1) mod m = 1, exit the loop (you've started the new Pisano Period).

Step 2: You know the pisanoPeriodLength now so you can use the fact 3) from above to calculate Fn mod m.

Hope this helps, if you need more details, I'll be happy to help. :)

 am not using any arrays or vectors, I just keep only needed variables to store the following:

F(i) mod m

f(i+1) mod m

F(i+2) mod m

pisanoPeriodLength
