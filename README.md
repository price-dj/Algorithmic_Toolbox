# Algorithmic_Toolbox

These files are my attempts at solutions for the weekly problems and assignments for this course. Don't expect the most advanced or most correct solutions.

MOOC on Coursera - Data Structures &amp; Algorithms - Algorithmic Toolbox given by UC San Diego undertaken in 2016

See: https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox

Algorithmic Toolbox is part of the Data Structures and Algorithms Specialisation

From the course website:

"This online course covers basic algorithmic techniques and ideas for computational problems arising frequently in practical applications: sorting and searching, divide and conquer, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming. We will learn a lot of theory: how to sort data and how it helps for searching; how to break a large problem into pieces and solve them recursively; when it makes sense to proceed greedily; how dynamic programming is used in genomic studies. You will practice solving computational problems, designing new algorithms, and implementing solutions efficiently (so that they run in less than a second)."

I would recommend the course for someone starting out trying to learn these concepts.
